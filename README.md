Machit is a memory card game which allows the uses to pick one of four subject based boards.
The object of the game is to find all ten matches, and when doing so the app will display number of turns that the user went. 
This app has both java and xml code and can run on many andriod devices.

This app is a school project. I used sample images from Google. If you own any of these images and object to their use here, please let me know and I'll be happy to take it down.
